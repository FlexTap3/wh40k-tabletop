# PLAYTEST-FINDINGS — Goal-1 (playability / mechanics / fun / 11th-ed fidelity)

Severity-ranked log from driving the **real UI** (Playwright/Chromium via `tools/shots`, immune
to the Brave wedge). Headless legality is covered separately by `tools/sim/auditor.js`; this file
is about the human-facing app — flow, dead-ends, UX friction, and mechanics as experienced.

## Pass 1 — solo game through the real UI (Gen 3, 2026-07-08)

Instrument: `tools/shots/playtest-ui.js` — drives a solo game via real button clicks, the phase
stepper, and the ⚔ attack tool's click-flow; captures console/page errors + screenshots at every
phase (reviewed visually). `discover.js` dumps the interactive surface.

**Headline (positive):** a full solo game **flows end-to-end through the actual UI with 0 console
errors** — load mission (5 obj, 2 DZ) → import + deploy 78 models → Solo dialog starts the AI
(deploys 39, holds reserves) → step all six phases (Command→End) → ⚔ tool populates a correct
weapon profile in the Attack tab → AI plays its turn → defender casualty-allocation prompt →
phone layout. This **closes a gap the session handoff flagged as never verified** ("still no live
two-window P2P game… no real game report"): solo play is now confirmed playable on a real render.
Screens reviewed: deployment, Solo dialog, Attack tab, phase transitions, after-AI-turn, phone.

### Findings

| # | Sev | Area | Finding | Status |
|---|-----|------|---------|--------|
| 1 | major | balance/onboarding | Solo dialog defaulted the AI to **1000 pts** regardless of the player's army → a new player gets a lopsided half-strength opponent (a typical list is ~1875–2000). | **FIXED** — defaults to standard **2000** (Strike Force), and on open auto-matches the player's loaded army to the nearest bracket (`aiSoloToggle`). |
| 2 | minor | UI | Per-phase reminder banner (e.g. "End of turn — Rapid Ingress may be used") renders over the top-right of the board. Useful coaching, dismissable, but overlaps tokens. | **FIXED in Pass 2** (see below) |
| 3 | minor | fidelity/import | Imported meta armies show "**base datasheet pts**" (e.g. Sororitas 1875, not 2000) — enhancements/proper costs aren't applied on import, so a player's list undercosts vs a legal 2000. Pre-existing (noted in handoff). | open (needs import-pipeline work) |

### Verified good (no action)
- Attack tab is faithful to 11th ed: Attacks/Hit/S/AP/D, Lethal/Sustained/Dev/Anti-X, re-roll
  hits/wounds, Cover(−1), Invuln, FNP, plus a Ld 2D6 battle-shock roller. Auto-populates from the ⚔ tool.
- Board legibility: leader rings, wound/model-count badges, objectives, terrain, DZ polygons all clear.
- Phone layout: board-first with bottom nav; the defender casualty-allocation flow (wounded-first
  rule + auto-assign) is presented cleanly on a 390px viewport.
- Solo dialog copy clearly explains sides, turn order, and to load a layout first.

**Next real-UI passes (per schedule):** Gen 8 — Cards/secondaries + CP/VP scoreboard + end-game.

## Pass 2 — Fight phase through the real UI (Gen 4, Lane B, 2026-07-08)

Instrument: **`tools/shots/fight-ui.js`** — a new sibling harness (Playwright/Chromium, Brave-wedge
immune) that sets up an engagement (a friendly melee unit ~1.5" from an enemy) and drives the whole
Fight cluster through the REAL UI: the ⚔ attack tool (melee engagement check), **Fire Overwatch**
(reactive, 6s-to-hit), a **2D6 charge** (ruler + dice roller), **Pile in / Consolidate** (3" caps,
via real `page.mouse` drags with snap-back), and **Fall Back** (`t.fellBack`). It captures
console/page errors + a screenshot at each step (reviewed visually). Buttons are driven by real DOM
`.click()` on the inspector/token-menu; drags by real mouse events through the app's own pointer
handlers. **Result: 11/11 steps ok, 0 console/page errors** before and after the fixes below.

**Headline:** the Fight-phase UX — never previously exercised on a live render — **works end-to-end
with 0 console errors**. Fall Back stamps `t.fellBack` (auto-clears next Movement phase); Fire
Overwatch routes through the real roller and forces Hit-on 6+; Pile in / Consolidate arm a hard 3"
cap that commits a ≤3" drag and **snaps a >3" drag back**; a phase change drops the armed cap. But
driving it surfaced one **rules-gate fidelity violation** (now fixed) plus assist-tool gaps.

### Findings (severity-ranked)

| # | Sev | Area | Finding | Status |
|---|-----|------|---------|--------|
| P2-1 | **MAJOR (fidelity gate)** | rules/fight | **Melee engagement range was 1" (10th ed), not 2" (11th ed).** The ⚔ attack tool (`wp3Stage`) and the two-click default-weapon picker (`wp15DefaultWi`) both used a `≤1.02"` threshold, so units **1.0–2.0" apart were flagged red "NOT within 1" / out of engagement** and the melee read as illegal — blocking a *legal* 11th-ed fight. Cites `../Notes/11th Edition Core Rules - Study Notes.md` line 8: "Engagement range is now 2" horizontally (5" vertically)." Internal inconsistency: the AI's own fight code already used `2.02"`. | **FIXED** |
| P2-2 | minor | UI | Per-phase reminder banner floated over the board's top-center, obscuring tokens **and blocking clicks** to them (Pass-1 open #2). | **FIXED** |
| P2-3 | minor | fidelity | A unit that **Fell Back** can still stage a shooting attack / charge — the app logs "no shooting or charging this turn" but (assist-only) does **not** block it. 11th ed forbids both. | open (needs enforcement gating) |
| P2-4 | minor | fidelity | **Fire Overwatch can be staged with a melee weapon** when the selected shooter has no ranged weapon (routes through the default-weapon picker, which falls back to melee). 11th Overwatch is a ranged snap-shot; a melee-only unit can't Overwatch. | open (guard shooter to ranged) |
| P2-5 | info | fidelity | **No dedicated "declare charge" action.** A charge is a composite of ruler-measure + the 2D6 dice roller + a manual move. So: no enforcement that the move ends within 2" engagement, a natural **2 isn't auto-failed**, no **Fights-First** / charged-this-turn tracking for fight ordering, and 11th's Overrun + three Consolidation modes aren't modeled. Consistent with the app's "assist, don't adjudicate" stance. | open (deferred; larger feature) |
| P2-6 | **MAJOR (fidelity gate)** | fidelity (AI lane) | The AI movement/charge/fight code used **1" engagement** (10th ed), not 11th's **2"**, in four places: `aiTryTranslate` non-charge avoidance (`edgeDist<=1.05`), `aiChargeUnit` already-engaged skip + charge-success threshold (`+1.02`), and `aiFightUnit` eligibility (`>1.02`). Non-charge moves stopping 1–2" from an enemy are illegal in 11th. | **FIXED (coordinator, Gen-4 integration)** — all four → 2.0x; charge move also capped to the 2D6 roll (was reaching base contact regardless of roll). Cost: 5-seed mean AIStrength 0.832→0.764 (removed 10th-ed-cheat inflation; fidelity trumps strength). 0 rules findings, suite green. |

### Fixes (each verified in-UI: 0→0 console errors, screenshot reviewed)

- **P2-1 (melee engagement 1"→2"):** `wp3Stage` and `wp15DefaultWi` now use `≤2.02"`; the hint text
  reads "NOT within 2\"". Regression tests: `wp3-tests.js` gains a **positive** assertion (melee at
  ~1.5" reads "in engagement range") alongside the existing out-of-range one, and both wp3/wp15
  engagement messages updated. **Before:** `fight-04` banner red "melee — closest models 1.5" (NOT
  within 1")". **After:** green "melee — closest models 1.5" (in engagement range)". `run_all.sh`
  green. *RULES-CRITICAL — flagged for your blessing per §9 integration gate.*
- **P2-2 (reminder banner):** CSS-only — banner is now `pointer-events:none` (clicks pass through to
  tokens; the ✕ button keeps `pointer-events:auto`), translucent (bg .94→.82), slimmer padding, and
  narrower (max-width 74%→60%). **Before/after screenshots:** `fight-09-banner.png` / the strip in
  `fight-03`/`fight-04` — tokens beneath stay visible and selectable; the coaching is retained.

### Verified good (no action)
- Pile in / Consolidate: real mouse drag ≤3" commits, >3" snaps back to start (hard cap, no advance
  leeway), logged; arming shown in the inspector and the ⋯ token menu. (`fight-05`, `fight-06`, `fight-07`)
- Fall Back button + ⋯-menu action stamp `t.fellBack` on every model; flag auto-clears when a fresh
  Movement phase begins. (`fight-02`)
- Fire Overwatch: reactive-only (non-active side, Movement/Charge phase), needs your unit + the enemy
  unit selected, forces Hit-on **6+**, routes through the normal attack roller. (`fight-03`)
- 2D6 charge roll via the dice roller logs to both peers; ruler tape measures the gap. (`fight-08`)

## Pass 3 — Cards / secondaries + CP/VP scoreboard + end-game through the real UI (Gen 5, Lane B, 2026-07-08)

Instrument: **`tools/shots/cards-ui.js`** — a new sibling harness (Playwright/Chromium, Brave-wedge
immune) driving the whole scoring cluster through the REAL UI: the Cards tab (🎴 draw secondaries,
the shared two-hand view, the editable 📖 card reader + Edit-deck dialog), the VP/CP scoreboard
steppers (real button clicks in `#scoreboard`), scoring across battle rounds, stepping the game to
its end (round 5 → over), and the ranged-only Fire Overwatch guard. Buttons are driven by real DOM
`.click()`; console/page errors + a screenshot captured at every step and reviewed visually.
**Result: 15/15 steps ok, 0 console/page errors** after the fixes below.

**Headline:** the scoring/cards UX — never previously exercised on a live render — **works
end-to-end with 0 console errors**. Secondaries draw into distinct hands, both hands render with
headers, the 📖 reader edits/persists/broadcasts card text, the deck editor rewrites the deck, and
the VP/CP steppers mutate the tracked score. Driving it confirmed the two prior-run facts and let me
fix both the phantom-CP end-game gap and P2-4 in the UI layer.

### Findings (severity-ranked)

| # | Sev | Area | Finding | Status |
|---|-----|------|---------|--------|
| P3-1 | **MAJOR (fidelity gate)** | rules/end-game | **No end-of-game handling** — stepping `›` past P2's End of round 5 rolled into a phantom round 6 whose Command phase auto-granted **+1 CP to both sides** (illegal: 11th ed is 5 battle rounds — Study Notes L28; CP is only gained in the Command phases of rounds 1–5). No end-of-game cue at all. | **FIXED** |
| P3-2 | minor | fidelity | **Fire Overwatch could be staged with a melee weapon** for a melee-only shooter (the `wp15` default-weapon picker fell back to melee). 11th Overwatch is a ranged snap-shot. (Pass-2 open **P2-4**.) | **FIXED** |
| P3-3 | minor | fidelity/UX | **No primary-scoring cue.** Primaries score progressively in the Command phase from round 2 (Study Notes L28), but nothing prompted it. | **FIXED** (reminder nudge) |
| P3-4 | **needs your judgment** | fidelity | **Secondary hands are SHARED** — each player sees the other's drawn Tactical cards (the Cards-tab copy even says so). 11th-ed matched-play Tactical secondaries are a **hidden** hand; the opponent shouldn't see them. A deliberate shared-table-aid choice, but a strict fidelity deviation. | open (design call — see below) |
| P3-5 | info | fidelity | **No automatic primary scoring.** VP is manual via the steppers; the app ships no VP rules (the paid Mission Deck has them). Consistent with the "assist, don't adjudicate" stance; P3-3 adds the coaching nudge. | open (intentional non-fix) |

### Fixes (each verified in-UI: 0→0 console errors, screenshot reviewed)

- **P3-1 (end-of-game / phantom round-6 CP):** the phase stepper still lets the round counter tick
  past 5 (headless drivers loop until `round>5`), but the app now (a) **guards the auto Command-phase
  +1 CP so it never fires once the game is over** (`round>WP7_LAST_ROUND`), and (b) shows an explicit
  **"🏁 Game over"** cue: the phase label, a scoreboard banner with the final VP + winner/draw, a
  reminder-banner line, a one-shot shared log summary, and the Round badge reads **"5 ✓"** (never a
  bare "6"). New `WP7_LAST_ROUND=5` + derived `wpGameOver()`; no new synced state (both peers derive
  it from `round`), fully back-compatible. Verified: driving the real stepper from Deploy through a
  full game ended at **10 CP each (was 11 with the phantom grant)**, label "🏁 Game over", scoreboard
  "Player 1 wins 20–0", and stepping again added **no** further CP. **Before:** round 5 → silent
  round 6, +1 CP/side. **After:** `cards-11-game-over.png` — Game-over banner + "5 ✓" + 10/10 CP.
  *RULES-CRITICAL — flagged for your blessing per §9.*
- **P3-2 (P2-4 ranged-only Overwatch):** `wp15DefaultWi` gained a `rangedOnly` flag (skips the melee
  auto-pick, returns −1 when the unit has no ranged weapon); `wp15Go` threads it and logs a clear
  reason; `wpFightOverwatch` calls `wp15Go(target,true)`. A melee-only shooter is now **blocked** with
  "…has no ranged weapon — Fire Overwatch is a ranged snap-shot…"; a ranged unit still stages at 6+.
  **Before:** melee weapon staged. **After:** `cards-09-overwatch-melee-blocked.png` (blocked) +
  `cards-08-overwatch-ranged-ok.png` (ranged still works).
- **P3-3 (primary-scoring cue):** the Command-phase reminder now appends **"· score your primary (use
  the VP steppers)"** in rounds 2–5 — a neutral coaching nudge, no rules prose, no auto-scoring.

### Needs your judgment (fidelity)
- **P3-4 shared vs hidden secondary hands.** Strict 11th-ed matched play keeps each player's Tactical
  hand secret. The app deliberately shares both hands (it's often a single-screen table aid, and the
  copy states it). Making hands hidden would be a real feature (per-side reveal/secrecy, network hand
  hiding) — I did **not** change it. Your call whether shared-hand is acceptable for this tool or
  worth a hidden-hand mode.

### Verified good (no action)
- 🎴 Draw a card adds **distinct** secondaries (dedupes against the current hand); both "Your hand"
  and the opponent's hand render with counts. (`cards-02`, `cards-03`)
- 📖 card reader: edits persist to `localStorage` + `cardText`, broadcast via a `cardtext` op, and
  re-render in the hand. Edit-deck dialog rewrites `secDeck`. (`cards-04`, `cards-05`, `cards-06`)
- VP/CP steppers (both the Cards-tab scoreboard and the top bar) mutate the tracked score and log
  manual CP changes; round 1–5 Command phases grant exactly one +1 CP each (10/10 over a full game).
  (`cards-07`)
- Primary-mission card shows the mission, objective count, editable primary summary, and the
  "Open in Event Companion (p.N)" deep-link. (`cards-01`)
